Colored Cells Problem Solution

Problem Statement

Given an integer n, determine the number of cells in an n x n grid where the center is filled first, and in each subsequent step, additional layers are added around it.

Approach

The problem follows a pattern where each new layer adds more cells to the previous total. The formula for counting cells at each step is derived as:

At n = 1, only 1 cell is present.

For n > 1, each new step adds 4 * (n - 1) additional cells.

This results in the following sum:

Total cells = 1 + 4 * (1) + 4 * (2) + ... + 4 * (n-1)

This can be efficiently implemented using a loop.

Solution Implementation

class Solution {
    public long coloredCells(int n) {
        if(n == 1) return 1;
        long sum = 1;
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            sum += 4 * i;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}

Complexity Analysis

The loop runs for n-1 iterations.

Each iteration performs a constant-time operation.

Therefore, the time complexity is O(n).
