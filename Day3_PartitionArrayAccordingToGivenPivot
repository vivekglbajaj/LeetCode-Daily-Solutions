Pivot Array Implementation

Overview

This program partitions an array around a given pivot while maintaining relative ordering. The goal is to:

Move elements less than the pivot to the left.

Place pivot elements in the middle.

Move elements greater than the pivot to the right while preserving their relative order.

Algorithm

The approach follows these steps:

Initialize Pointers:

l (left pointer) starts at 0 to place smaller elements.

r (right pointer) starts at n-1 to place larger elements.

Iterate Through the Array:

If an element is less than pivot, place it at res[l] and increment l.

If an element is greater than pivot, place it at res[r] and decrement r.

Place Pivot Elements:

Fill the range [l, r] with the pivot.

Sort the Elements Greater than Pivot:

Reverse the elements placed at the right side to maintain ascending order.

Time & Space Complexity

Time Complexity: O(n), since we iterate through the array multiple times.

Space Complexity: O(n), as we use an additional array res[].

Example

Input:

nums = [9, 12, 5, 10, 14, 3, 10], pivot = 10

Output:

[9, 5, 3, 10, 10, 12, 14]

Edge Cases Considered

Array contains only one element

All elements are greater or smaller than pivot

Array has multiple pivot occurrences

Already sorted array

Improvements

The current approach uses extra space (O(n)). It can be optimized further using in-place modifications to achieve O(1) space complexity.
