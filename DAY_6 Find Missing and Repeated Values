Find Missing and Repeated Values in a Grid
Problem Statement
Given an n × n grid where numbers range from 1 to n², exactly one number is missing, and one number is repeated. Your task is to find the missing and repeated numbers.

Approach
This solution uses a boolean array to track occurrences of numbers.

Create a boolean array (res) of size n² + 1 to track seen numbers.
Traverse the grid, marking numbers in res.
If a number is already marked, it is the repeated number.
Find the missing number by checking which index in res remains false.
Time Complexity Analysis
O(n²) for traversing the n × n grid.
O(n²) for checking the missing number.
Overall Complexity: O(n²) (Optimal for this problem).
Solution:
class Solution {
    public int[] findMissingAndRepeatedValues(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int total = n*n;
        boolean[] res = new boolean[total+1];
        int repeat = -1,missing = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i<n;i++){
            for(int j = 0; j<n;j++){
                int num = grid[i][j];
                if(res[num]){
                    repeat = num;
                }
                res[num] = true;
               
            }
    
        }
        for(int i = 1; i<=total;i++){
            if(!res[i]){
                missing = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return new int[]{repeat,missing};
    }
}
